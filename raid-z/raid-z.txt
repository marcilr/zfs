RAID-Z


Disks fail.  One method of avoiding data loss from disk failure is to
implement RAID.  ZFS supports this feature in its pool design.  RAID-Z
pools require three or more disks but provide more usable space than
mirrored pools.

Performance, capacity and data integrity
========================================
        Raids have three main advantages over using a single disk.
               Performance, capacity and data integrity.

                               capacity
                                  /\
                                 /  \
                                /    \
                               /      \ 
                  performance /________\ integrity

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each raid type ?
=============================================================
raid0 or striping array has no redundancy, but provides the best performance
  and additional storage.  Any drive failure destroys the entire array so
  raid 0 is not safe at all.  if you need really fast scratch space for
  videoediting then raid0 does well.

raid1 or mirroring simply mirrors the same data over every drive in the
  array.  This is excellent redundancy as you can lose every drive except
  one and still have access to the data.  A positive is the raid read
  speed is increased by every drive added to the array.  The big negative
  is low capacity and slow write speed speeds.  No matter how many drives
  are in the raid you have the total capacity of a single drive to use.
  Speed is reduced because every drive gets a complete copy of the same
  files.  Mirroring is normally used for two(2) drives, not for 12 and
  24 like in our tests due to the incredible amount of wasted space.

raid 2, raid 3 and raid 4 are not tested as they are no longer used by the
  IT industry.  Raid2 uses an equal amount of disks as dedicated ECC drives.
  Raid 3 and 4 use a single dedicated parity drive.  None of these raids are
  used in production anymore due to horrible random read and write
  performance.

raid5 or raidz distributes parity along with the data and can lose one
  physical drive before a raid failure.  Because parity needs to be
  calculated raid 5 is slower then raid0, but raid 5 is much safer.
  RAID 5 requires at least three hard disks in which one(1) full disk of
  space is used for parity.

raid6 or raidz2 distributes parity along with the data and can lose two
  physical drives instead of just one like raid 5.  Because more parity
  needs to be calculated raid 6 is slower then raid5, but raid6 is safer.
  raidz2 requires at least four disks and will use two(2) disks of space
  for parity.

raid7 or raidz3 distributes parity just like raid 5 and 6, but raid7 can
  lose three physical drives.  Since triple parity needs to be calculated
  raid 7 is slower then raid5 and raid 6, but raid 7 is the safest of the
  three.  raidz3 requires at least four, but should be used with no less
  then five(5) disks, of which three(3) disks of space are used for parity.

raid10 or raid1+0 is mirroring and striping of data.  The simplest raid10
  array has four disks and consists of two pairs of mirrors.  Disk 1 and 2
  are mirrors and separately disk 3 and 4 are another mirror.  Data is then
  striped (think raid0) across both mirrors.  You can lose one drive in each
  mirror and the data is still safe.  You can not lose both drives which make
  up one mirror, for example drives 1 and 2 can not be lost at the same time.
  Raid 10 's advantage is reading data is fast.  The disadvantages are the
  writes are slow (multiple mirrors) and capacity is low.

raid60 or raid6+0 is a stripe of two or more raid6 volumes. You get the
  advantage of raid6 safety (lose two drives per raid6 array) and of raid0
  striping read speeds. The negatives are the same as raid10.

raid70 or raid7+0 is a stripe of two or more raid7 volumes.  Just like raid6,
  you take advantage of raid7 safety and raid0 striping read speeds, but lose
  capacity.

Quick Summery: ZFS Speeds and Capacity
======================================
The following table shows a summery of all the tests and lists the number of
disks, raid types, capacity and performance metrics for easy comparison.
The speeds display "w" for write, "rw" for rewrite and "r" for read and
throughput is in megabytes per second.

ZFS uses variable-sized blocks of up to 1024 kilobytes.  If data compression
(LZJB or LZ4) is enabled, variable block sizes are used.  If a block can be
compressed to fit into a smaller block size, the smaller size is used on the
disk to use less storage and improve IO throughput at the cost of increased
CPU use for the compression and decompression operations.  Take a look at our
compression study further down this page.

When building a RAID it is common practice to use the "power of two plus
parity" raid infrastructure to maximize parity striping, speed and well as
capacity.  When using ZFS the standard RAID rules may not apply, especially
when LZ4 compression is active.  ZFS can vary the size of the stripes on each
disk and compression can make those stripes unpredictable.  The current rule
of thumb when making a ZFS raid is:

o MIRROR (raid1) used with two(2) to four(4) disks or more.
o RAIDZ-1 (raid5) used with five(5) disks or more.
o RAIDZ-2 (raid6) used with six(6) disk or more.
o RAIDZ-3 (raid7) used with eleven(11) disks or more.
