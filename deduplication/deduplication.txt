Deduplication


Data deduplication capabilities were added to the ZFS source repository
at the end of October 2009,[56] and relevant OpenSolaris ZFS development
packages have been available since December 3, 2009 (build 128).

Effective use of deduplication may require large RAM capacity.
Recommendations range from 1 GB for every extra 1 TB of storage[57]
to 2 GB for every TB of storage.[58][59]  Insufficient physical memory
or lack of ZFS cache can result in virtual memory thrashing, which can
either lower performance, or result in complete memory starvation.
[citation needed]  Solid-state drives (SSDs) can be used to cache
deduplication tables, thereby speeding up deduplication performance.
[citation needed]

Other storage vendors use modified versions of ZFS to achieve very high
compression ratios.  Two examples in 2012 were GreenBytes[60] and
Tegile.[61]
