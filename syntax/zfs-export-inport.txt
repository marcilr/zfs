Exporting Storage Pools


When the migration is ready to take place, before unplugging the power, you need to export the
storage pool.  This will cause the kernel to flush all pending data to disk, writes data to the
disk acknowledging that the export was done, and removes all knowledge that the storage pool
existed in the system.  At this point, it's safe to shut down the computer, and remove the drives.

If you do not export the storage pool before removing the drives, you will not be able to import
the drives on the new system, and you might not have gotten all unwritten data flushed to disk.
Even though the data will remain consistent due to the nature of the filesystem, when importing,
it will appear to the old system as a faulted pool.  Further, the destination system will refuse
to import a pool that has not been explicitly exported.  This is to prevent race conditions with
network attached storage that may be already using the pool.

To export a storage pool, use the following command:
  # zpool export tank

This command will attempt to unmount all ZFS datasets as well as the pool. By default, when
creating ZFS storage pools and filesystems, they are automatically mounted to the system.
There is no need to explicitly unmount the filesystems as you with with ext3 or ext4.  The export
will handle that.  Further, some pools may refuse to be exported, for whatever reason.  You can
pass the "-f" switch if needed to force the export


Importing Storage Pools
-----------------------
Once the drives have been physically installed into the new server, you can import the pool.
Further, the new system may have multiple pools installed, to which you will want to determine
which pool to import, or to import them all.  If the storage pool "tank" does not already exist on
the new server, and this is the pool you wish to import, then you can run the following command:

# zpool import tank
# zpool status tank
 state: ONLINE
 scan: none requested
config:

        NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        tank        ONLINE       0     0     0
          mirror-0  ONLINE       0     0     0
            sde     ONLINE       0     0     0
            sdf     ONLINE       0     0     0
          mirror-1  ONLINE       0     0     0
            sdg     ONLINE       0     0     0
            sdh     ONLINE       0     0     0
          mirror-2  ONLINE       0     0     0
            sdi     ONLINE       0     0     0
            sdj     ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors


Your storage pool state may not be "ONLINE", meaning that everything is healthy.  If the system
does not recognize a disk in your pool, you may get a "DEGRADED" state.  If one or more of the
drives appear as faulty to the system, then you may get a "FAULTED" state in your pool.  You will
need to troubleshoot what drives are causing the problem, and fix accordingly.

You can import multiple pools simultaneously by either specifying each pool as an argument, or by
passing the "-a" switch for importing all discovered pools.  For importing the two pools "tank1"
and "tank2", type:

# zpool import tank1 tank2
For importing all known pools, type:

# zpool import -a
